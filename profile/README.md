## 💡 Overview  

**Midnight Commander (MC)** is a classic **file management application** designed for efficiency, stability, and simplicity. Originally created for Unix systems, it has become a cross-platform favorite for developers, system administrators, and power users who value speed and control over their file operations.  

The software features a **dual-panel interface**, allowing users to copy, move, compare, and organize files with ease. Its keyboard-driven workflow ensures maximum productivity, while support for mouse interaction makes it equally convenient for new users.  

Beyond simple file management, **Midnight Commander** includes a built-in **text editor**, archive browser, FTP/SFTP client, and virtual file system support. These features make it more than just a file manager — it’s a full-fledged terminal-based workspace for managing data efficiently.  

Lightweight and highly customizable, **Midnight Commander** remains one of the most trusted tools for professionals who prefer a terminal-centric workflow combined with powerful file-handling capabilities.
